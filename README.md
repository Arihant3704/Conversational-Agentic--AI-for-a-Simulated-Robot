Based on the transcript from the video **"[How LLMs (Large Language Models) Power JetRover Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqcXD34EuyY)" by Merlin AI**, the JetRover robot demonstrates a variety of tasks and behaviors powered by LLMs and agentic AI design. Here's a list of **agent tools** you could build or define within this agentic AI framework based on the video:

---

### üß† **Perception & Understanding Tools**

1. **Object Detection Tool**

   * Detect specific objects like: `medicine box`, `remote control`, `breakfast`, `bath supplies`, `blocks`, `purple ball`, `carrot`, `Jeep`.

2. **Object Tracking Tool**

   * Follow a moving or stationary object (e.g., ball, carrot, Jeep).

3. **Scene Description Tool**

   * Visually analyze the surroundings and describe the environment using LLM-generated language.

4. **Obstacle Detection Tool**

   * Identify obstacles and trigger a stop or rerouting.

### üèÉ **Mobility & Navigation Tools**

5. **Move To Location Tool**

   * Navigate from one room to another (e.g., living room ‚Üí bedroom ‚Üí bathroom ‚Üí kitchen).

6. **Follow Line Tool**

   * Follow a black line on the ground and stop upon detecting an obstacle.

7. **Return to Start Tool**

   * Return to a starting point after completing a task.

8. **Precision Movement Tool**

   * Execute specific movement sequences (e.g., spin, move forward/back/left/right for specified durations, drift in place).

### üì¶ **Manipulation Tools**

9. **Pick and Place Tool**

   * Pick up objects (e.g., medicine box, remote, breakfast, bath supplies) and place them in a designated location.

10. **Sorting Tool**

* Sort colored blocks (red, green, blue) into matching boxes.

---

### üßæ **Task Planning & Execution Tools**

11. **Command Interpretation Tool**

* Convert spoken or written commands into structured tasks the robot can execute.

12. **Task Sequencer Tool**

* Chain subtasks (e.g., move, detect, pick up, drop off) in order to complete a complex instruction.

13. **Error Recovery Tool**

* Handle failure cases, such as object not found or path blocked.

---

### üì° **Interaction Tools**

14. **Voice Assistant Tool**

* Respond to ‚ÄúHello, High Wonder‚Äù and listen for follow-up instructions.

15. **Speech Generation Tool**

* Generate voice responses like ‚ÄúMedicine box on the way‚Äù or ‚ÄúJeep detected and ready to track.‚Äù

These tools form the **modular capabilities** of an agentic AI robot system powered by LLMs and perception/motor control stacks. Each tool corresponds to a discrete skill or API-style callable action that can be invoked by a central planner or decision engine.
